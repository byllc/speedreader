      Now this is a story, of about how, my life got flipped turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute. Just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became the prince
      of a town called Bel Air. In West Philadelphia. Born and Raised. On the playground is where I spent most of my days. Chillin out maxin relaxin all cool and then 
      shootin' some bball outside of school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good. Started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight. And my mom got 
      scared. She said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle from Bel Air."
